For Dr. Shakkottai's ECEN 424 class.  
Easier to put notes here for you guys. I'm only gonna code for another 30 minutes or so. - p
Whenever you do a new command in Connections.java, see how I did it and make sure you set command=true so it doesn't tell other players a command was issued. - p
Oh yeah I just realized you can't get a new host the way I implemented it. Not sure how to fix this at the moment cause host and player are two different extensions of connection and you can't call them without opening a new thread (connection), so you'd have to close the socket or smth to change to host. - p
